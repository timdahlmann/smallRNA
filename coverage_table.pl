=head2 VERSION
Verion #1 from 08.10.2020

=head3 DISCRIPTION
Reads in several 'depth' output files from BEDtools and combines them to a output file containing the read depths of all samples for C. neoformans chr01 from position 2200000 until its end.
This was independently performed for the forward and reverse strand of C. neoformans chr01.
The output file contains the read depth for that specified region for all five samples.
